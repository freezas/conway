# conway

This is a personal side project for fun and learning.

It's a relatively simple and fun project to keep playing around with:

* good code design
* good documentation
* Some user interface with data that changes
* Something with as less external libraries as possible
* Something that works with a CLI first
  (so I can also play around with it on my mobile)

## Installation

Requirements:

* Python3.6+

Clone this project and run it first with `python conway.py` or
`python3 conway.py`.
